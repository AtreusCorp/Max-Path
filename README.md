# Max-Path
A simple program for finding maximal paths from the top of a triangle to its bottom. Note that this was heavily inspired by Problem 67 of the Project Euler archive.

As a command line argument, pass a text file representing a triangle of numbers formatted in the way of example.txt. The output will be a visual representation of the maximal path from the top of the triangle to somewhere on the bottom as well as the value of the sum over such a path.
